.SH "SYNOPSIS"

moc [options] <source\-file|header\-file> [<source\-file|header\-file>] ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
moc reads one or more \*(C+ class declarations from a \*(C+ header or source file
and generates one \*(C+ source file containing meta object information for the
classes. The \*(C+ source file generated by the moc must be compiled and linked
with the implementation of the class (or it can be #included into the class's
source file).

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
The moc does not expand #include or #define, it simply skips any
preprocessor directives it encounters. This is regrettable, but is normally
not a problem in practice.
.PP
The moc does not handle all of \*(C+. The main problem is that class
templates cannot have signals or slots. This is an important bug. Here is
an example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    class SomeTemplate<int> : public QFrame {
\&        Q_OBJECT
\&        ....
\&    signals:
\&        void bugInMocDetected( int );
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Less importantly, the following constructs are illegal. All of them have
have alternatives which we think are usually better, so removing these
limitations is not a high priority for us.
.SS "Multiple inheritance requires QObject to be first."
.IX Subsection "Multiple inheritance requires QObject to be first."
.Vb 3
\&    If you are using multiple inheritance, moc assumes that the first inherited
\&    class is a subclass of QObject. Also, be sure that only the first inherited
\&    class is a QObject.
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject, public OtherClass {
\&            ...
\&        };
\&
\&    This bug is almost impossible to fix; since the moc does not expand #include
\&    or #define, it cannot find out which one of the base classes is a QObject.
.Ve
.SS "Function pointers cannot be arguments to signals or slots."
.IX Subsection "Function pointers cannot be arguments to signals or slots."
.Vb 2
\&    In most cases where you would consider that, we think inheritance is a
\&    better alternative. Here is an example of illegal syntax:
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&            ...
\&        public slots:
\&            // illegal
\&            void apply( void (*apply)(List *, void *), void * );
\&        };
\&
\&    You can work around this restriction like this:
\&
\&        typedef void (*ApplyFunctionType)( List *, void * );
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&            ...
\&        public slots:
\&            void apply( ApplyFunctionType, char * );
\&        };
\&
\&    It  may  sometimes  be  even  better  to  replace  the function pointer with
\&    inheritance and virtual functions, signals or slots.
.Ve
.SS "Friend declarations cannot be placed in signals or slots sections"
.IX Subsection "Friend declarations cannot be placed in signals or slots sections"
.Vb 3
\&    Sometimes it will work, but in general, friend declarations cannot be placed
\&    in signals or slots sections. Put them in the good old private, protected
\&    or public sections instead. Here is an example of the illegal syntax:
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&            ...
\&        signals:
\&            friend class ClassTemplate<char>; // illegal
\&        };
.Ve
.SS "Signals and slots cannot be upgraded"
.IX Subsection "Signals and slots cannot be upgraded"
.Vb 2
\&    The C++ feature of upgrading an inherited member function to public status
\&    is not extended to cover signals and slots. Here is an illegal example:
\&
\&        class Whatever : public QButtonGroup {
\&            ...
\&        public slots:
\&            QButtonGroup::buttonPressed; // illegal
\&            ...
\&        };
\&
\&    The QButtonGroup::buttonPressed() slot is protected.
\&
\&    C++ quiz: What happens if you try to upgrade a protected member function
\&    which is overloaded?
\&
\&        \- All the functions are upgraded.
\&
\&        \- That is not legal C++.
.Ve
.SS "Type macros cannot be used for signal and slot arguments"
.IX Subsection "Type macros cannot be used for signal and slot arguments"
.Vb 2
\&    Since the moc does not expand #define, type macros that take an argument
\&    will not work in signals and slots. Here is an illegal example:
\&
\&        #ifdef Q_OS_LINUX
\&        #define SIGNEDNESS(a) unsigned a
\&        #else
\&        #define SIGNEDNESS(a) a
\&        #endif
\&        class Whatever : public QObject {
\&            ...
\&        signals:
\&            void someSignal( SIGNEDNESS(int) ); // illegal
\&        };
\&
\&    A #define without arguments works.
.Ve
.SS "Nested  classes  cannot  be in the signals or slots sections nor have signals or slots"
.IX Subsection "Nested classes cannot be in the signals or slots sections nor have signals or slots"
.Vb 1
\&    Here\*(Aqs an example:
\&
\&        class A {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&        public:
\&            class B {
\&            public slots: // illegal
\&                void b();
\&                ...
\&            };
\&        signals:
\&            class B {  // illegal
\&                void b();
\&            ...
\&            }:
\&        };
.Ve
.SS "Constructors cannot be used in signals or slots sections"
.IX Subsection "Constructors cannot be used in signals or slots sections"
.Vb 4
\&    It is a mystery to us why anyone would put a constructor on either the
\&    signals or slots sections. You can\*(Aqt, anyway (except that it happens to
\&    work in some cases). Put them in private, protected or public sections,
\&    where they belong. Here is an example of the illegal syntax:
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&        public slots:
\&            SomeClass( QObject *parent, const char *name )
\&                : QObject( parent, name ) {} // illegal
\&            ...
\&        };
.Ve
.SS "Properties need to be declared before the public section that contains the respective get and set functions"
.IX Subsection "Properties need to be declared before the public section that contains the respective get and set functions"
.Vb 4
\&    Declaring the first property within or after the public section that
\&    contains the type definition and the respective get and set functions does
\&    not work as expected. The moc will complain that it can neither find the
\&    functions nor resolve the type. Here is an example of the illegal syntax:
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&        public:
\&            ...
\&            // illegal
\&            Q_PROPERTY( Priority priority READ priority WRITE setPriority )
\&            Q_ENUMS( Priority )
\&            enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
\&            void setPriority( Priority );
\&            Priority priority() const;
\&            ...
\&        };
\&
\&    Work  around this limitation by declaring all properties at the beginning of
\&    the class declaration, right after Q_OBJECT:
\&
\&        class SomeClass : public QObject {
\&            Q_OBJECT
\&            Q_PROPERTY( Priority priority READ priority WRITE setPriority )
\&            Q_ENUMS( Priority )
\&        public:
\&            ...
\&            enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
\&            void setPriority( Priority );
\&            Priority priority() const;
\&            ...
\&        };
