The libraries included here are the original packages, unpacked, and
with their version number removed from the directory name (for version
information, see the README files in the directories).

Certain files and subdirectories of the original library packages that
are irrelevant to Katie may not be included here. Typically, those are
the standalone library configuration and make files, tools, test
files, contribs, documentation, and similar.
